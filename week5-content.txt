@WWNN
300/18 news
The President has cancelled a press conference today, citing the "fake news" media. Speculation is rampant that he has been infected with what scientists are calling the Z-virus.
@glorenzo: 182/10 science
What Helix Laboratories has dubbed the "Z-virus" is VERY dangerous and VERY contagious as far as we know. Everyone stay inside.
@nattybanks: 192/7 concern
Gayle, the public barely has any information other than frantic reports from news outlets... do you have anything for us???
@glorenzo: 709/2 science
No worries, Natalie. I will be publishing a journal very soon with Helix Laboratories' findings about the "Z-virus".
@nattybanks: 587/90 citizen
Thank you Gayle! We need more scientists like you.
@deplorablemike: 200/51 maga
Real Americans aren't fooled by fake news!
