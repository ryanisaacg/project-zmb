@WWNN
200/15 news
On one side, politicians. On the other, epidemielogists. One says this is business as usual, with an unusually bad flu season. The other says we should be very worried.
@deplorablemike: 150/16 maga
Fearmongering to hurt the President won't work! Wonder who is funding these "experts."
@glorenzo: 15/30 science
Are you suggesting my colleagues and I are being paid to <i>lie</i>?
@deplorablemike: 60/3 maga
You said it, not me!

@glorenzo
100/18 science
I hate to make public statements like this, but the equivocation by @WWNN is dangerous. This is not a flu. We are facing an unprecedented crisis.
@wwnnpaulklein: 200/63 news
What is it then? I think the public deserves both sides of the story, especially in the case of a developing story.
@glorenzo: 150/13 science
What sides? My lab is one of the only places that has sequenced the virus's genome. What other side is there?
@deplorablemike: 100/13 maga
I don't know, just the LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD? typical coastal elite
@wwnnpaulklein: 60/25 none
As much as I hate to agree with Mike, I can't belive you're dismissing POTUS like this @glorenzo
@glorenzo: 5/31 science
I have better things to do than get into arguments online.
