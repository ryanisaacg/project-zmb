@WWNN
500/22 news
It is important, in these turbulent times, to avoid spreading rumors and misinformation. There is no evidence that this year's influenza is anything out of the ordinary! Read more about the flu vaccine on our website.
@glorenzo: 30/45 science
I'm not sure we can be this confident about anything at the current moment! It might be best to refrain from making definitive statements until we know more.
@cl928238: 100/15 conspiracy
Vaccines are poison anyway!! Jail the criminals who push them on our kids.
@wwnnpaulklein: 130/16 news
Author of the article here: don't you think waiting for scientific consensus is irresponsible? @glorenzo
@anarkeereinz: 50/3 conspiracy
We all know the flu is a CIA psy-op
@glorenzo: 3/10 science
I'm just saying that we don't know enough to assert that this disease is an ordinary flu.
