Uncomfirmed reports say the President has been injured or killed in a struggle with the Secret Service. More on this story as it develops.

New information indicates the President physically attacked the Speaker of the House, who is now in critical condition. During a subsequent altercation, a Secret Service member discharged their weapon, killing POTUS. See the latest on our website.
